title: "Run request from button field"
---

Button fields in Airtable let you run Data Fetcher requests directly from your table (or interface) without opening the extension dashboard. This saves you time and allows you to run requests using values from specific records.

## **How to set up button fields**

Follow these steps to create your first button field request:

1. [**Create and save a request**](/create-requests/create-a-request) in Data Fetcher. You can close the extension dashboard afterward, but remain logged into Data Fetcher.
2. [Create a button field](https://support.airtable.com/docs/button-field) in Airtable that opens Data Fetcher.
3. Click any button in your new button field column.
4. A modal will appear asking you to select which request / sequence to run. Use the **Request** dropdown menu to make your selection.
5. Click **Save**  to save your selection, and run the request immediately.

After this initial setup, clicking any button in that field will run your selected request immediately without requiring you to set it up again.

## **Configure multiple button setups**

You can assign different requests (and [sequences](/create-sequences/create-a-sequence)) to button fields across different tables or views within the same table.

1. Open the Buttons modal by clicking **Buttons** in the top menu on Data Fetcher's home screen.
2. Add a new configuration by clicking **\+ Add** and selecting your table, view, and request / sequence.
3. Set view specificity by either selecting a specific view or leaving it blank to apply to all views in the table.
4. Click**Save**  to confirm your configuration.

**Note:** Each table and view combination can only have one assigned request / sequence. If you configure both a general table setting (blank view) and a specific view setting, the specific view setting takes priority.

## **Choose your execution scope**

When working with requests that [run on multiple records](/create-requests/use-table-values-in-requests#run-on-multiple-records), button fields offer two execution options:

- **Single record mode (default):** The request runs only for the record containing the clicked button.
- **Multiple records mode:** The request runs for every record in your request's designated **Run on Multiple Records** view.

To use multiple records mode, enable **Run on multiple records, not just the record clicked** when configuring your button setup.
