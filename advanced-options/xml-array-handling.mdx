title: "XML array handling"
---

When you fetch XML responses using Data Fetcher, it converts XML into tabular data (fields and records) in two steps:

1. The [xml2js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xml2js) package transforms XML to a JavaScript object.
2. This object is then converted into tabular data (fields and records) using the standard [response data transformation](https://help.datafetcher.com/advanced-options/response-data-transformations).

By default, XML child nodes are only treated as arrays when there are multiple nodes. Single nodes are treated as individual objects.

To treat all child nodes as arrays, even when there's only one:

1. Navigate to the request screen in Data Fetcher.
2. Scroll down to the bottom and click to open the **Advanced settings**.
3. Under **XML Array Handling**, toggle on **Always put child nodes in array**.
