title: "Response data transformations"

When you run a request, the response data gets transformed into a tabular format with fields and records for your output table. You control this process using response field mapping and response data transformation settings.

## **Understanding the two transformation types**

Data Fetcher offers two ways to handle nested arrays in your API responses: **Single Record** and **Expanded**. The key difference is how they treat nested data.

Let's use this sample JSON response to illustrate both approaches:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "company1",
    "positions": [
      { "id": "position1" },
      { "id": "position2" }
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": "company2",
    "positions": [
      { "id": "position3" },
      { "id": "position4" }
    ]
  }
]
```

## **Single record transformation**

**Single Record** keeps each parent entity in one row by combining nested values with commas. Each company stays in its own record:

| **Id**   | **Positions id**    |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| company1 | position1,position2 |
| company2 | position3,position4 |

<Info>
  **Single Record** doesn't mean everything goes into one record. Data Fetcher finds the first array in your response and creates one record for each item in that array.
</Info>

## **Expanded transformation**

Expanded creates separate records for each nested item, duplicating parent data across multiple rows:

| **Id**   | **Positions id** |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| company1 | position1        |
| company1 | position2        |
| company2 | position3        |
| company2 | position4        |

## **How to set the transformation mode**

1. On the create screen, scroll to the bottom and click to open the **Advanced Settings**.
2. Under **Data Transformation**, select either Single Record or Expanded

**Note:** These settings are also available on the [Response Field Mapping](https://help.datafetcher.com/create-requests/response-field-mapping#access-advanced-settings).

## **Advanced single record options**

#### **Combine nested object keys**

By default, nested object values are combined into comma-separated fields. Using our example above, all `positions.id` values become one single-line text field called "Positions id".

You can disable this to create separate numbered fields instead:
