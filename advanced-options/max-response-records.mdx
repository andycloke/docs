title: "Max response records"
---

When Data Fetcher processes an API response, it can sometimes return more records than you need. Use the **Max response records** setting to limit the number of records in your output.

For example, if an API returns 100 records, but you only want the first 10, set **Max response records** to 10.

## **Set the max response records**

1. On the request screen, click to open the **Advanced settings**.
2. Scroll to **Max response records**, and enter the maximum number of records you want to receive.
3. When you run the request, the [Response field mapping](/create-requests/response-field-mapping) will refresh with the Max response records setting applied.
