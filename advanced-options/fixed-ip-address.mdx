title: "Fixed IP Address"
---

Some APIs require you to add specific IP addresses to an allowlist before accepting connections. Data Fetcher's Fixed IP Address feature ensures your requests always come from the same IP address, making it easy to meet this security requirement.

<Info>This feature requires a paid Data Fetcher plan.</Info>

### **How to Turn On Fixed IP Address**

1. Navigate to the request screen in Data Fetcher.
2. Scroll down to the bottom and click to open the **Advanced settings**.
3. Under **Fixed IP Address**, toggle on **Use fixed IP address**.
4. Your requests will now consistently run from the following IP address:

```
54.173.229.200
```

When configuring your API services, add this IP address to their allowlist settings to ensure successful connections.
