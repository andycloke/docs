title: "Rate limit"
---

Many APIs enforce rate limits to prevent overuse - typically expressed as a maximum number of requests per minute or second. When you exceed these limits, APIs may reject your requests or temporarily block access.

Data Fetcher helps you stay within these boundaries by automatically adding delays between requests when you configure a rate limit.

## **How to set a rate limit**

1. Navigate to the request screen in Data Fetcher.
2. Scroll down to the bottom and click to open the **Advanced settings**.
3. In the **Rate Limit (requests per minute)** field, enter your desired limit.
4. **Save** your request.

Data Fetcher will automatically pace your requests to stay within the specified limit, preventing API errors.
