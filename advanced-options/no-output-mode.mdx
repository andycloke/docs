title: "No output mode"
---

No output mode prevents Data Fetcher from creating or updating records in your base when a request runs. This is useful when you're working with API endpoints that don't return data or when you want to ignore API responses entirely.

## **When to use no output mode:**

- API endpoints that do not return anything in their response.
- POST or PATCH requests where you're sending data from Airtable rather than importing data with GET requests.

When no output mode is enabled, the output table / view selection, response field mapping, and data transformation options are hidden since they are not needed.

## **How to enable no output mode**

1. Navigate to the request screen in Data Fetcher.
2. Scroll down to the bottom and click to open the **Advanced settings**.
3. Under **No Output Mode**, enable **Do not handle the response or update the base**.
4. You will see a warning modal, since this option is rarely used. Click **Turn on "No Output Mode"**.
5. Click **Save** to save the request.

Next time you run the request, the API request will be made, but no data will be written to Airtable.
