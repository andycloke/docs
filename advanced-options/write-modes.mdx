title: "Write modes"

When Data Fetcher runs your request, it transforms the API response into tabular data (fields and records) and writes it to your output view. You can control how this data is written using **Write Mode** settings.

## **Choose Your Write Mode**

- [**Append**](https://help.datafetcher.com/advanced-options/write-modes#append-mode) - Add new records without changing existing ones.
- [**Update**](https://help.datafetcher.com/advanced-options/write-modes#update-mode) - Modify existing records and optionally add new ones.

## **How to set the write mode**

1. Navigate to the request screen in Data Fetcher.
2. Scroll down to the bottom and click to open the **Advanced settings**.
3. Under **Write Mode**, select your preferred option.

### **Append mode**

Append mode adds new records to your table without modifying existing data. This is perfect for tracking data over time, like daily sales reports or periodic updates.

**Example scenario:** You're tracking item sales and want to see how numbers change daily.

Your current table in Airtable:

| Item Id | Item name  | **Units sold** |
| ------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| 229     | Orange Hat | 5              |
| 107     | Orange Hat | 10             |
