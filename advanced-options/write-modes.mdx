title: "Write modes"

When Data Fetcher runs your request, it transforms the API response into tabular data (fields and records) and writes it to your output view. You can control how this data is written using **Write Mode** settings.

## **Choose Your Write Mode**

- [**Append**](/advanced-options/write-modes#append-mode) - Add new records without changing existing ones.
- [**Update**](/advanced-options/write-modes#update-mode) - Modify existing records and optionally add new ones.

## **How to set the write mode**

1. Navigate to the request screen in Data Fetcher.
2. Scroll down to the bottom and click to open the **Advanced settings**.
3. Under **Write Mode**, select your preferred option.

### **Append mode**

Append mode adds new records to your table without modifying existing data. This is perfect for tracking data over time, like daily sales reports or periodic updates.

**Example scenario:** You're tracking item sales and want to see how numbers change daily.

Your current table in Airtable:

| Item Id | Item name    | **Units sold** |
| ------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| 229     | Orange Hat   | 5              |
| 107     | Purple Skirt | 10             |

Today's API response:

| Item Id | Item name    | **Units sold** |
| :------ | :----------- | :------------- |
| 692     | Blue T-Shirt | 7              |
| 229     | Orange Hat   | 10             |
| 107     | Purple Skirt | 17             |

After running with Append mode:

| Item Id | Item name    | **Units sold** |
| :------ | :----------- | :------------- |
| 229     | Orange Hat   | 5              |
| 107     | Purple Skirt | 10             |
| 692     | Blue T-Shirt | 7              |
| 229     | Orange Hat   | 10             |
| 107     | Purple Skirt | 17             |

With a "Created time" field in Airtable, you could use this setup to track how units sold changes for each item over time.

### **Update mode**

Update mode refreshes existing records with new data. Any additional records from the API response can be created as new records (this behavior is optional).

Using the same example data from above, after running with Update mode:

| Item Id | Item name    | **Units sold** |
| :------ | :----------- | :------------- |
| 692     | Blue T-Shirt | 7              |
| 229     | Orange Hat   | 10             |
| 107     | Purple Skirt | 17             |

**Important: Matching Records Correctly**

In the example above, there's a problem. The first record that was originally "Orange Hat" is now "Blue T-Shirt," which could break any links or comments associated with that record.

**Solution:** Set an **Update Based on Field** to match records properly.

To avoid mismatched updates:

1. In **Advanced Settings**, find **Update Based on Field(s)**
2. Choose a unique identifier like "Item ID"

With "Item ID" as the matching field, records update correctly:

| Item Id | Item name    | **Units sold** |
| :------ | :----------- | :------------- |
| 229     | Orange Hat   | 10             |
| 107     | Purple Skirt | 17             |
| 692     | Blue T-Shirt | 7              |

<Note>
  Use an output view without Airtable filters to ensure Data Fetcher can find
  all matching records. Filtered views may cause duplicate records if matches
  are hidden.
</Note>

## **Additional update options**

### **Create leftover records**

By default, any new records in the API response are added to your table. To change this:

1. Open **Advanced Settings**
2. Toggle **Create records leftover after update** on or off

### **Delete missing records**

Remove records from your table that no longer appear in the API response. This is useful when the source application has deleted data.

1. Open **Advanced Settings**
2. Toggle **Delete records not found in the API response** on or off

**Important:** This only affects records visible in your output view. Use a view without filters to ensure all records are considered for deletion.
