title: "Upload requests from JSON file"

Data Fetcher allows you to easily upload requests from previously [downloaded JSON files](/organise-requests/export-requests-as-json-file), making it simple to share request configurations across different bases or workspaces.

Alternatively, if you want to share requests with your team, can [add team members to your Data Fetcher workspace](/account/add-user-to-account).

Data Fetcher also supports [importing from cURL commands](/organise-requests/import-request-from-curl-command).

## **How to import requests from a JSON file**

Follow these steps to import previously exported Data Fetcher requests:

1. Click the ⬆️ button (**Upload requests or import cURL**) in the top menu
2. In the modal that appears, click **Upload file**.
3. Select a Data Fetcher requests JSON file that you previously downloaded.
4. Choose your desired **Output table** and **Output view** using the dropdown menus.
   1. For requests that **Run on Multiple Records**, you will need to select a table and view for that too.
5. Click **Import** to complete the process.
