Duplicating requests saves you time by creating an identical copy of a configured request instead of starting from scratch

## **How to duplicate a request**

You can duplicate a request in two ways:

### **From the home screen:**

1. Navigate to the home screen in Data Fetcher.
2. Locate the request you want to duplicate.
3. Hover your mouse over the request, and click the three dots (...) on the right-hand side.
4. Select **Duplicate** from the menu.

A new request will immediately appear in your list, containing all the same settings and parameters as the original.

### **From the request screen:**

1. Open the request you want to duplicate.
2. Click the **Duplicate** button in the top menu.

A new request will be created, and you'll be automatically taken to the duplicated request screen, where you can begin making changes.
