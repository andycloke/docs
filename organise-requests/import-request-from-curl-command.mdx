Save time by importing cURL commands directly into Data Fetcher. This feature allows you to instantly set up requests without manually configuring headers, parameters, or authentication details.

## **What is cURL?**

cURL (Client URL) is an industry-standard command-line tool for transferring data and making API requests. You'll commonly encounter cURL commands:

- Throughout API documentation
- In code samples shared by developers
- When [inspecting network requests in your browser's developer tools](https://www.scrapingbee.com/tutorials/how-to-extract-curl-requests-from-chrome/)

For example, you might want to import the following cURL command from [Stripe's API documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers/list):

```bash
curl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \
  -u 2430578aslkdfjh43254332: \
  -d limit=3
```
