title: "Download requests as JSON file"
---

Downloading requests creates JSON files you can re-use in other bases. Only request configurations and response JSON are exported, not workspace data, base information, or personal settings.

## **How to download requests as JSON files**

1. Sign in to your account and navigate to the Data Fetcher extension home screen.
2. Hover your mouse over the requests you want to download and click the empty checkbox (☐) next to each one to select them.
3. Once you've selected all desired requests, click the ⬇️ button (**Download requests)** that appears in the menu bar.
4. In the download requests modal, click **Download** to save the JSON file to your computer.

The file will be downloaded to your default downloads location with a name based on the current time.

## **Security considerations when exporting requests**

**Important:** Be mindful about sensitive information when exporting requests. Your export may contain:

- API keys and authentication tokens
- Private endpoint URLs
- Custom headers with sensitive information
- Personally identifiable information in request parameters or response JSON

For better security, consider these best practices:

1. [Replace sensitive values with variables](/create-requests/use-variables-in-requests) before exporting, so only variable names (not actual values) are included in the export file.
2. Review the JSON file before sharing it with others to ensure no confidential information is accidentally disclosed.
3. If sharing exported requests with team members, use secure channels for file transfer.

Your exported requests can be imported into any Data Fetcher installation using the [Import from JSON feature](/organise-requests/import-requests-from-json-file).
