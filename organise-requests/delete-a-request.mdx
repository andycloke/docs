title: "Delete a request"

You can remove saved requests you no longer need from your Data Fetcher workspace using either the extension or the website.

## **How to delete a request from the extension**

1. Open the Data Fetcher extension.
2. On the home screen, locate the request you want to delete.
3. Hover your mouse over the request and click the **...** (three dots) that appears on the right-hand side.
4. Click **Delete** from the dropdown menu.
5. Click **Confirm** to permanently remove the request.

## **Delete a request when the Airtable base has been deleted**

If you've already deleted the Airtable base containing your request, you'll need to use the Data Fetcher website instead:

1. Sign in to your account at https://datafetcher.com/sign-in.
2. Under **Workspaces**, click **Manage workspace** next to the workspace where the request is saved.
3. Click **View saved requests** to see all requests in that workspace.
4. Find the request you want to delete and click the three dots (**...**) next to its name.
5. Click the **Delete** button (🗑️) that appears in the popup menu.
6. Click **Delete** on the confirmation modal to permanently remove the request.

Note that deleted requests cannot be recovered, so make sure you no longer need the request before deleting it.
