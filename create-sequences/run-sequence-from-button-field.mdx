title: "Run sequence from button field"
---

You can run a sequence by clicking a button field in your table. This makes it quicker to execute sequences without having to manually navigate through the extension dashboard.

<Info>
  Button fields work similarly for both requests and sequences. This guide focuses on sequences specifically.

## **Run a sequence from a button field**

1. Create and save your sequence first. You can close the extension dashboard afterward, but remain logged into Data Fetcher.
2. [Create a button field](https://support.airtable.com/docs/button-field) in Airtable that opens Data Fetcher.
3. Click any button in this new button field.
4. A modal will appear asking you to select which sequence to run. Use the **Sequence** dropdown menu to make your selection.
5. Click **Save** to run the sequence immediately.
6. For future uses, simply click the button field and the sequence will run automatically without prompting for selection.

## **Run different sequences from different buttons**

This functionality works identically to request buttons. See [Run different requests from different buttons](/advanced-options/run-request-from-button-field#run-different-requests-from-different-buttons) for complete instructions.

## **Running a sequence on one record versus multiple records**

This functionality works identically to request buttons. See [Running a request on one record versus multiple records](/advanced-options/run-request-from-button-field#run-request-for-one-record-vs-run-on-multiple-records) for detailed guidance.
