Data Fetcher allows you to schedule sequences to run automatically on a regular basis, even when you're not logged into Airtable or don't have the Data Fetcher extension open.

<Info>
  This feature requires a paid Data Fetcher plan.
</Info>

To schedule sequences, you will first need to [authorize Data Fetcher and Airtable](https://help.datafetcher.com/account/authorize-data-fetcher-airtable).

## **Schedule a sequence**

After authorizing Data Fetcher, you can create your schedule:

1. On the sequence screen, find the **Schedule** section.
2. Toggle on **Schedule this sequence.**
3. Select an **Interval** from the dropdown menu (Minutes, Hours, Days, Weeks, Months).
4. Specify the frequency (e.g., every 1 hour, every 3 days).
5. If applicable, select which days of the week the sequence should run.
6. Optional: Change the timezone if needed
   - This option is available for all intervals except **Hours**
7. Click **Save** to activate your schedule.

Your sequence will now run automatically according to your specified schedule, without requiring you to manually trigger it.
