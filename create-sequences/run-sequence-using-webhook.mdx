title: "Run sequence using webhook URL"
---

A webhook URL allows you to run a sequence automatically when specific events occur, such as when an Airtable record updates or when someone submits a form.

<Info>
  This feature requires a paid Data Fetcher plan.

## **Enable the Webhook URL for a Sequence**

To make your sequence runnable via webhook URL:

1. On the sequence screen, click the \*\*Webhook URL \*\*tab.
2. Toggle on **Turn on webhook for sequence.**
3. Click the clipboard icon (📋) to copy your unique webhook URL, which looks like:

```
https://hook.datafetcher.com/h/sr4X86TTJ747CAPj9gVU9mrKnN33wKqT46CbaaTxnaXqsr
```

4. Test your webhook by visiting the URL in your browser - you should see a success message and the sequence will run immediately.

## **Run sequence for a specific record**

To run your sequence for just one particular record:

1. Make sure all requests in your sequence use the same **Run on Multiple Records** table.
2. Add the `record_id` parameter to your webhook URL like this:

```
https://hook.datafetcher.com/h/sr4X86TTJ747CAPj9gVU9mrKnN33wKqT46CbaaTxnaXqsr?record_id=reca19WnKiU2L46cj
```

3. The record ID used must belong to a record in your specified table.
