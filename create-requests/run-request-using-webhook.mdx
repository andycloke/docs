title: "Run request using webhook URL"
---

Every Data Fetcher request can be triggered automatically using its unique webhook URL. This allows external systems to run your requests by making HTTP calls to the webhook URL. For example, you can trigger data imports when a form is submitted on your website, when an e-commerce order is placed, or when events occur in other business tools.

You can also use webhook URLs within Airtable Automations to run requests based on any [automation trigger](https://support.airtable.com/docs/airtable-triggers).

  This feature requires a paid Data Fetcher plan.

## **Set up request webhook URL**

### **Authorize Data Fetcher**

Before using webhooks, you need to authorize Data Fetcher to access your Airtable account. You only need to complete this once.

[For detailed authorization instructions, see our guide](https://help.datafetcher.com/account/authorize-data-fetcher-airtable).

### **Turn on the webhook URL**

1. On the request screen, click the **Webhook URL** tab.
2. Toggle on **Turn on webhook for request**.
3. Copy the webhook URL by clicking the copy icon (📋) next to it. Your webhook URL will look similar to this:

```
https://hook.datafetcher.com/h/rj4X86TTJ747CAPj9gVU9mrKnN33wKqT46CbaaTxnaXqsr
```

4. Test the webhook by visiting the URL in your browser. You should see a success message, and you can verify the request ran by checking the Run History.

## **Using webhook URLs**

#### **Run for all records**

Once your webhook is active, calling the webhook URL will execute your request with its current configuration. This is useful for triggering data imports or updates from external systems.

#### **Run for a specific record**

You can target a specific record by adding a `record_id` parameter to the webhook URL. First, make sure you've selected a **Run on Multiple Records** table and view in your request's advanced settings.

With the record ID parameter, your webhook URL becomes:

```
https://hook.datafetcher.com/h/rr4X86TTJ747CAPj9gVU9mrKnN33wKqT46CbaaTxnaXqsr?record_id=reca19WnKiU2L46cj
```

## **Integrate with Airtable Automations**

You can trigger Data Fetcher requests directly from Airtable Automations, allowing you to run requests when records are updated, forms are submitted, conditions are met, or any other automation trigger fires.

### **Basic automation setup**

1. Create an Airtable automation with your desired [trigger](https://support.airtable.com/airtable-triggers) (e.g., **When a record updated**).
2. For the automation action, select **Run a script**.
3. Add this script, replacing `YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL` with your actual webhook URL:

```
await fetch(`YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL`);
```

### **Target a specific record from automation**

To run the request for only the record that triggered the automation:

1. In your Airtable automation, add an input variable called `record_id` with the record ID from the trigger.
2. Use this script instead, replacing `YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL` with your webhook URL:

```
await fetch(`YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL?record_id=${input.config().record_id}`)
```

This approach ensures your Data Fetcher request processes only the specific record that triggered the automation, making your workflows more efficient and targeted.
