title: "Run request using webhook URL"
---

Every Data Fetcher request can be triggered automatically using its unique webhook URL. This allows external systems to run your requests by making HTTP calls to the webhook URL. For example, you can trigger data imports when a form is submitted on your website, when an e-commerce order is placed, or when events occur in other business tools.
