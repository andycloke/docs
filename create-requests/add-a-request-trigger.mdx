title: "Add a request trigger"
---

Request triggers automatically run your Data Fetcher requests whenever specific changes occur in your Airtable base. Your requests will execute automatically when records are created, updated, or deleted - even when you're not logged into Airtable or don't have Data Fetcher open.

Unlike scheduled requests that run at fixed intervals, triggers respond to events in near real-time, making them ideal for workflows that need immediate data synchronization or notifications.

## **Set up a request trigger**

### **Authorize Data Fetcher**

Before creating triggers, you need to authorize Data Fetcher to access your Airtable account using OAuth. You only need to complete this authorization once.

[For detailed authorization instructions, see our guide to authorization](/account/authorize-data-fetcher-airtable).

### **Configure the trigger**

1. On the custom request screen, click the **Trigger** tab.
2. Select your trigger type from the available options:

   - **Record created** - Runs when new records are added
   - **Record updated** - Runs when existing records are modified
   - **Record deleted** - Runs when records are removed

   You can select multiple trigger types if needed.

3. Choose the **Table** you want to monitor for changes.
4. Optionally, select a specific **View** to limit the trigger scope. If no view is selected, all record changes in the table will trigger the request.
5. If you selected **Record updated**, choose which specific fields to monitor for changes.
6. Click **Save** to activate your trigger.

Once your trigger is active, you can verify it's working by making a test change to your table and checking the [Run History](/organise-requests/run-history) to see if the request executed automatically.

## **Trigger limitations**

You can add a maximum of two triggers per base (across all Data Fetcher installations in that base and workspace) due to Airtable's webhook API limitations.

## **Advanced trigger options**

### **Run when a record enters a view**

You can trigger requests when records enter a specific view by using the **Record created** trigger type and selecting both a **Table** and **View**. This is useful for workflows where records moving into a view indicates they're ready for processing.

### **Include Airtable API changes**

By default, triggers ignore changes made through the Airtable REST API to prevent conflicts. You can enable the **Run when the base is changed via the Airtable API** setting to include these changes.

<Warning>
  Enabling API change detection can cause infinite loops. This happens when a
  trigger-created or trigger-updated record causes the same trigger to run
  again, potentially consuming your entire monthly usage limit. Only enable this
  setting if you're certain your workflow won't create feedback loops.
</Warning>
