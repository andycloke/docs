## **Set up response field mapping**

### **Initial setup**

When you create a request for the first time:

1. Click **Save & Run** on your request configuration.
2. The Response Field Mapping modal will open, showing all available fields from the API response along with a preview of the records.

### **Map your fields**

For each response field, you can:

- **Select or deselect fields** - Only data from selected fields will be imported when the request runs.
- **Map to existing fields** - Select **Existing field** and choose a field from the dropdown to use an existing column in your table.
- **Map to new fields** - Select **New field**, enter a field name, and choose a field type. Data Fetcher automatically suggests appropriate field types based on the response data.
- **Search for fields** - Use the **Find field** input to quickly locate specific fields in large responses.

Once you've configured your mappings, click **Save & Run**. Data Fetcher will create any new fields and import your data.

## **Updating field mappings**

### **Reopen field mapping**

After your initial setup, you can modify field mappings anytime by clicking **Open field mapping** on your request.

### **Refresh fields**

When your API response changes (for example, due to parameter updates), you can refresh available fields without using your monthly usage limits:

1. Click **Open field mapping**.
2. Click **Refresh fields** in the top-right corner.
