## **Set up response field mapping**

### **Initial setup**

When you create a request for the first time:

1. Click **Save & Run** on your request configuration.
2. The Response Field Mapping modal will open, showing all available fields from the API response along with a preview of the records.

### **Map your fields**

For each response field, you can:

- **Select or deselect fields** - Only data from selected fields will be imported when the request runs.
- **Map to existing fields** - Select **Existing field** and choose a field from the dropdown to use an existing column in your table.
- **Map to new fields** - Select **New field**, enter a field name, and choose a field type. Data Fetcher automatically suggests appropriate field types based on the response data.
- **Search for fields** - Use the **Find field** input to quickly locate specific fields in large responses.

Once you've configured your mappings, click **Save & Run**. Data Fetcher will create any new fields and import your data.

## **Updating field mappings**

### **Reopen field mapping**

After your initial setup, you can modify field mappings anytime by clicking **Open field mapping** on your request.

### **Refresh fields**

When your API response changes (for example, due to parameter updates), you can refresh available fields without using your monthly usage limits:

1. Click **Open field mapping**.
2. Click **Refresh fields** in the top-right corner.

The field mappings also refresh automatically when you change [Response data transformations,](https://help.datafetcher.com/advanced-options/response-data-transformations) [Response JMESPath](https://help.datafetcher.com/advanced-options/response-jmespath), or [Max response records](https://help.datafetcher.com/advanced-options/max-response-records).

## **Additional field options**

### **Transform data with formulas**

Apply transformations to field values before they reach your output table using formulas. Reference the original value as `value` in your formula (e.g., `upper(value)`).

1. Click the settings icon next to any field to open field settings.
2. Enter your formula in the **Formula** input.
3. Click **Save**.

You can find a full list of [available formulas here](https://formula.github.io/formula/docs/code/src/functions) and test them in our [JavaScript Formula Playground](https://datafetcher.com/javascript-formula-playground).

### **Create linked records**

Data Fetcher can automatically create and update linked records during imports. This is useful when you have related data, such as tasks linked to users.

**Use an existing linked field:**

1. Select **Existing field** and choose a linked field from your output table.
2. By default, Data Fetcher uses the primary field in the linked table to find records. To change this, click the field settings icon and select a different field under **Linked table field**.

**Create a new linked field:**

1. Select **New field**, enter a field name, and set the field type to **Linked record.**
2. Click the field settings icon and select a table to link to under **Linked table**.

When the request runs, Data Fetcher will create links by looking for response values in the linked table. If no matching record is found, it will create a new record automatically.

### **Link to multiple records**

Enable comma-separated values to create multiple linked records:

1. Click the field settings icon next to the field name.
2. Under **Allow multiple links**, select **Allow**.

#### **Create missing linked records**

By default, Data Fetcher creates missing records in linked tables. You can disable this for read-only tables:

1. Click the settings icon next to the field name.
2. Under **Create missing records**, enable or disable **Create**.

### **Handle attachment fields**

Map remote file URLs (PNG, SVG, PDF, etc.) directly to Airtable attachment fields by selecting **Attachment** as the field type.

**Add to existing attachments** instead of overwriting:

1. Click the settings icon next to the attachment field.
2. Under **Attachment write mode**, enable **Add to existing**.
3. Click **Save**.

**Only write if cell is empty:**

1. Click the settings icon next to the attachment field.
2. Under **Write the attachment only if the cell is empty**, enable **Only if empty**.
3. Click **Save**.
