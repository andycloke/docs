Adding a request body allows you to send data from your Airtable base to other platforms. You can include table values, variables, and even attachment files in your request body.

Data Fetcher supports seven different body types: JSON, x-www-form-urlencoded, form-data, XML, GraphQL, Binary, and Plain Text. You'll typically want to add a request body when using POST, PATCH, or PUT request methods. Check your target API's documentation to determine which body type to use.

### **JSON request body**

JSON is commonly used for REST APIs and web services.

1. Make sure the **JSON** tab is active.
2. Enter your JSON data into the input field. You can validate your JSON using this tool.
3. Use the **Beautify** button to format your JSON for better readability.

### **x-www-form-urlencoded request body**

This format sends data as key-value pairs, similar to HTML form submissions.

1. Click the **x-www-form-urlencoded** tab.
2. Click **\+ Add** to create a new key-value pair.
3. Enter a key and its corresponding value in the input fields.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 to add additional key-value pairs as needed.

### **form-data request body**

Form-data is useful for sending files or when the API specifically requires this format.

1. Click the **form-data** tab.
2. Click **\+ Add** to create a new key-value pair.
3. Enter a key and its corresponding value in the input fields.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 to add additional key-value pairs as needed.

### **XML request body**

XML format is often used by older APIs or enterprise systems.

1. Click the **XML** tab.
2. Enter your XML content in the input field. You can validate your XML using this tool.

### **GraphQL request body**

GraphQL allows you to query specific data fields and is automatically converted to JSON when sent.

1. Click the **GraphQL** tab.
2. Add your GraphQL query in the **Query** input field.
3. Add any variables as JSON in the **Variables** input field.
4. When the request runs, Data Fetcher automatically converts your GraphQL query and variables into a JSON body. You can preview this conversion using our GraphQL to JSON Body Converter.

### **Binary request body**

Binary format sends raw file data, perfect for uploading attachments from Airtable.

1. Click the **Binary** tab.
2. Use the **\+** button on the right side of the input field to reference an attachment field from your Airtable base.
3. When the request runs, the raw attachment data will be sent directly in the request body.

### **Plain Text request body**

Plain text format sends simple text content without any special formatting or encoding.

1. Click the **Plain Text** tab.
2. Enter your text content directly in the input field.
3. The text will be sent exactly as entered in the request body.
