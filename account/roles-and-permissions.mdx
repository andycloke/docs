## **Workspace roles**

Data Fetcher has two distinct user roles with different permission levels:

- **Owner** - full administrative control to add/remove users, manage billing, delete workspaces, and monitor usage. Owners can create, update, delete, duplicate, and run all requests and sequences. A workspace can have multiple owners, and must always have at least one.
- **Creator** - operational permissions focused on working with data. Creators can create, update, delete, duplicate, and run requests and sequences, but cannot perform administrative functions.

## **Change a user's role**

As an Owner, you can modify the roles of other users in your workspace:

1. Hover your mouse over the Data Fetcher extension.
2. Click the **Settings** icon (⚙) that appears in the top-right corner.
3. In the settings screen, locate the **Workspaces** section where your available workspaces are listed.
4. Click **Manage workspace** on your chosen workspace. You may need to click **Switch to this workspace** first.
5. Find the **Users** section, where you will see a list of the users in the workspace.
6. Click the **Edit** icon (✏️) next to the user's role.
7. Select the desired role from the dropdown.
8. Click **Save** to update that user's role.
