title: "View monthly usage"
---

Your Data Fetcher plan includes a monthly allowance of runs and response records. Usage resets on the same day each month that you originally upgraded your workspace - not at the start of each calendar month.

## **What counts as a run?**

A run is a single API request. Each time you click the **Run** button, you'll use at least one run from your monthly allowance. Here's when you might use multiple runs:

1. [Run on Multiple Records](https://help.datafetcher.com/create-requests/use-table-values-in-requests#run-on-multiple-records): When you apply a request across multiple Airtable records, each record processed counts as one separate run. For example, fetching stock prices for 20 records would use 20 runs.
2. [Pagination](https://help.datafetcher.com/advanced-options/pagination): When your request retrieves data across multiple pages, each page fetched counts as one run. For instance, if results span 3 pages, that's 3 runs.

Failed API requests don't count against your usage, and creating or refreshing your response field mapping is also free.

## **What counts as a response record?**

When you run a request, Data Fetcher transforms the API response into Airtable records using your configured [response data transformation](https://help.datafetcher.com/advanced-options/response-data-transformations) and [field mapping](https://help.datafetcher.com/create-requests/response-field-mapping). The number of records counted against your usage is based on how many transformed items result from this process, not how many values actually change in Airtable.

For example:

- A response containing a list of 50 items would count as 50 records (even if sent in a single run).
- A response containing a single object would count as just 1 record.

## **How do different run types affect my usage?**

All types of runs in Data Fetcher consume your monthly allowance in the same way, regardless of how they're triggered:

- **Manual runs**: When you click the **Run** button yourself
- **Scheduled runs**: When Data Fetcher automatically runs requests on your defined schedule
- **Webhook URL runs**: When your request is triggered by calling a request webhook URL
- **Trigger runs**: When a request is triggered by a record being created, updated or deleted

Each of these methods counts as one or more runs against your monthly allowance, following the same rules. For example, if a scheduled request retrieves paginated data across 3 pages, it will use 3 runs—exactly the same as if you had clicked **Run** manually and retrieved the same data.

The same applies to response records - the number of records used depends on the data returned, not how the request was triggered.
