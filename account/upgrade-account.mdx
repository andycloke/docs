Upgrading your Data Fetcher workspace unlocks advanced features and higher usage limits for your entire team. A workspace upgrade provides:

- Increased [usage limits](/account/view-monthly-usage)
- Ability to [schedule automated requests](/create-requests/schedule-a-request)
- Ability to [trigger requests](/create-requests/add-a-request-trigger) when a record is created / updated / deleted
- Ability to [run requests using a webhook URL](/create-requests/run-request-using-webhook)
- Additional [team member seats](/account/add-user-to-account) (Pro, Business & Business + plans).

All billing occurs at the workspace level, meaning your entire team benefits from a single subscription.
