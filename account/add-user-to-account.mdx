## **How to add a user to your workspace**

1. Hover over the Data Fetcher extension, then click to open the settings screen.
2. On the settings screen, under **Workspaces**, click **Manage workspace** next to the workspace you want to add the user to.
3. Scroll down to the **Users** section of the workspace screen, and click **Add User**.
4. Enter the user's **Email** in the input field.
5. Select a role for the user:
   1. **Owner** - Can add/remove users, manage billing, delete the workspace, monitor usage, and work with requests.
   2. **Creator** - Can create, update, delete, duplicate, and run requests and sequences.
6. Click **Add**.

The user will be added to your workspace. They'll receive an invitation email and can access your workspace whenever they sign in to the Data Fetcher extension.
