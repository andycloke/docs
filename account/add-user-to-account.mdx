2. On the settings screen, under **Workspaces**, click **Manage workspace** next to the workspace you want to add the user to.
3. Scroll down to the **Users** section of the workspace screen, and click **Add User**.
4. Enter the user's **Email** in the input field.
5. Select a role for the user:
   1. **Owner** - Can add/remove users, manage billing, delete the workspace, monitor usage, and work with requests.
   2. **Creator** - Can create, update, delete, duplicate, and run requests and sequences.

The user will be added to your workspace. They'll receive an invitation email and can access your workspace whenever they sign in to the Data Fetcher extension.
