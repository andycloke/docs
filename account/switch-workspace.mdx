## **What is a Data Fetcher workspace?**

Workspaces in Data Fetcher are shared collaborative environments where team members can access, edit, and run saved requests together. Think of them like Airtable workspaces—they provide a central location where everyone on your team sees the same content.

When you sign up for Data Fetcher, we automatically create a default workspace for you. You may also be invited to join existing workspaces created by your teammates.

### **Key things to know about workspaces**

- All billing information and usage limits are tied to the workspace, not individual users
- Any changes you make to requests are visible to all workspace members
- Switching between workspaces is easy within the Data Fetcher extension and website

## **How to switch between Data Fetcher workspaces**

Follow these simple steps to change which workspace you're currently using:

1. Hover your mouse over the Data Fetcher extension.
2. Click the **Settings** icon (⚙️) that appears in the top-right corner.
3. In the settings screen, locate the **Workspaces** section where your available workspaces are listed.
4. Find the workspace you want to use and click the **Switch to this workspace** button next to it.
5. Click **Back** in the bottom-left corner to return to the home screen.

After switching, all saved requests and settings will reflect those of your newly selected workspace. Your team members using the same workspace will see identical content.
