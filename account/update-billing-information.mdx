2. Under **Workspaces**, click **Manage workspace** next to the workspace you want to update billing information for.
3. On the workspace page, click **Update payment card or view invoices**.
4. This will redirect you to Stripe (Data Fetcher's payment processor).
5. Find the **BILLING INFORMATION** section.
6. Click **Update information**.
7. Make your changes to the billing name, address and/or email address.
8. Click **Save** to apply your changes.
